## Key Interaction Points

1.  **Initial CTA Click**: A primary conversion point for users already convinced by the hero section.
2.  **Module Accordion Interaction**: The core exploratory phase where the user evaluates the course content's value.
3.  **Final CTA Click**: The secondary, and often primary, conversion point for users who needed to review the full page before making a decision.
